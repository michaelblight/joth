## *General*

<details><summary><b>Why?</b></summary><p><p>

In the late 90s early 2000s, I was creating web apps using XML and client-side transformation using MS-XSL and then XSLT for IE-only. It worked well, 
so why change it! JSON has overtaken popularity from XML, so this started as a proof-of-concept that things could be simpler than the 
Angular/React/Vue approaches.

In my view, libraries should do one small thing to help you on your way. They should not tell you how to organise your application. I've written frameworks 
before. It was a mistake.
